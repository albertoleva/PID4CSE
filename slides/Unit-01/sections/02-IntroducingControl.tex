\framesubtitleTC{Just a couple of examples} 
\myPause
\begin{itemize}[<+-| alert@+>]
\item Many synonyms (most dangerous ones for us in bold):
      \begin{itemize}
      \item[] bridle, \textbf{check}, constrain, contain, curb, govern, hold, inhibit, \\
              keep, \textbf{measure}, pull in, regulate, rein (in), restrain,\\
              rule, tame,...
      \end{itemize}
\item Many meanings depending on the viewpoint.
\item[] \vspace{-1.5mm}For example, the controls of an aircraft ``regulate or guide'' its operation.
\item[] \vspace{-0.75mm}Fine. So what kind of object/entity do we mean here for ``controls''?
      \begin{itemize}
      \item The knobs, levers and so forth that the pilot manoeuvres?
      \item ...or the autopilot computer with its software?
      \item ...or the ailerons, the rudder and the like?
      \item ...or the compound of all of these?
      \end{itemize}
      \myPause
\item \vfill We definitely need to state our terminology and notation precisely.
