PID Control for Computer Engineers -- with a Systems and Control Theory micro-course in disguise

This repository refers to a teaching activity on PID control targeted to Computer Scientists and Engineers, whence the acronym; while addressing PID control, the occasion is taken to also introduce some more general Systems and Control Theory concepts, to help the student get a methodologically grounded grasp on the subject, hence use the technology in a conscious manner. 

When referring to this activity and material, please cite

A. Leva, "PID control education for computer engineering students: a step to bridge a cultural gap", IFAC Journal of Systems and Control (at present in press, complete info will be given here as soon as available).

This repository contains teaching material in the form of
 - pdf slides,
 - LaTeX source files and graphics to compile the said slides,
 - wxMaxima and Scilab scripts, and Modelica models, to support the activity.

NOTE: the repository is at present in preparation, material upload will start soon. To give an idea of the content, however, a draft version of the pdf slides is already present (unit 8 still being written, references to be added).
