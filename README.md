PID Control for Computer Engineers -- with a Systems and Control Theory micro-course in disguise

This repository refers to a teaching activity on PID control targeted to Computer Scientists and Engineers, whence the acronym; while addressing PID control, the occasion is taken to also introduce some more general Systems and Control Theory concepts, to help the student get a methodologically grounded grasp on the subject, hence use the technology in a conscious manner.
